# Ci/CD Pipeline Steps 


### 1. Pre-Deployment: Generate and Secure the Expected State

1. Generate the Fingerprint:
    * Compute a composite cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) of:
        * Source code files.
        * Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) manifests (e.g., terraform, ansible).
        * Configuration files (e.g., '''.env''', Kubernetes manifests).
        * Build artifacts (e.g., Docker image digests, binaries).
    * Example: Use a deterministic method like find . -type f to ensure reproducibility.
2. Sign the Fingerprint:
    * Use a cryptographic private key (e.g., GPG or PKI) to sign the fingerprint file.
    * Ensure the public key is published for verification.
3. Publish the Fingerprint:
    * Store the fingerprint and its signature alongside build artifacts in a publicly accessible location:
        * GitHub Releases.
        * Artifact repositories like AWS S3, Nexus, or JFrog.
        * Add the fingerprint to deployment documentation for user access.
4. Store Metadata for Traceability
    * Record metadata such as:
        * Commit hash.
        * Timestamp.
        * Build and deployment environment details.
    * Include the metadata in the published fingerprint file.


### 2. Deployment: Verify and Log Deployed State

1. Verify Artifacts Match Expected State
   * Before deployment, verify that the artifacts match the signed fingerprint.
   * Log the verification results to an immutable audit trail.
2. Deploy Artifacts and Infrastructure
   * Use IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi) to deploy infrastructure.
   * Deploy validated containerized services or binaries.
   * Log artifact hashes for auditing.


### 3. Post-Deployment: Expose Runtime State

1. Expose Runtime Fingerprint
   * Provide an API or CLI endpoint to expose runtime details:
     * Container image digests.
     * Active IaC metadata.
     * Application configurations (excluding sensitive data).
2. Generate Runtime Fingerprint
   * Dynamically compute a runtime fingerprint based on the exposed details.
   * Ensure consistency with the expected fingerprint's components.


### 4. Validation: Facilitate Independent Verification

1. User Verification Tools
   * Provide CLI tools or scripts to:
     * Fetch the expected fingerprint and verify its signature.
     * Query the runtime environment for its state.
     * Compare the runtime fingerprint with the expected fingerprint.
2. Audit Trail
   * Publish logs of verification checks.
   * Store these logs in an immutable or tamper-evident location (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, blockchain).


## Cryptographic Measures

1. Cryptographic Hashing
   * Use secure hashing algorithms like SHA256 or SHA512.
   * Ensure deterministic hashing for reproducibility.
2. Digital Signatures
   * Use private keys (e.g., GPG) to sign fingerprints.
   * Publish public keys for verification.
3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   * Maintain a trusted PKI system:
     * Publish public keys in a verifiable location (e.g., Keybase, GitHub).
     * Periodically rotate and revoke keys when needed.
4. Secure Communication
   * Use HTTPS for all fingerprint and runtime API queries.
   * Optionally sign API responses with a server key for added trust.
5. Immutable Logs
   * Store logs and fingerprints in tamper-evident systems:
     * Examples: AWS CloudTrail, HashiCorp Vault, or blockchain.
